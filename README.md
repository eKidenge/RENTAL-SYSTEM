# RENTAL-SYSTEM

Rental is a web application, where people, who have shifted to a new location, can get their dream house to live on rent in a cheap and easy way.

Another aspect of the application is that it also provides people a platform to post advertisements for their houses and rooms.

It works as a mediator between customers and owners.

It also provides you with a range of houses based on your preferences such as cost, location, features, etc.

It is made using the Django framework of Python.

## How to Install:

1. You need to have Python installed on your system.

4. Run the system on localhost by executing the `manage.py` file (`python manage.py runserver`).
